### 1. Brief Product Description
ShopSavvy is a grocery comparison application that allows users to find the lowest price points at their local grocery stores and plan their shopping trip. This web application is simplistic and intuitive to allow any user, whether tech savvy or not, to enjoy the benefits ShopSavvy has to offer. Our motivation is to help individuals and families budget their grocery purchases by providing economic options to get the best value out for the money spent. The unique value of this application comes from the gas calculator feature. This allows users to view the estimated gas cost for driving to one or many grocery store locations. Additionally, users can search through numerous products and categories, and quickly see which store offers the best deals while factoring in both the grocery price and fuel costs. This helps users make a more informed decision on where they would like to shop. With ShopSavvy, planning shopping trips becomes easier, and savings become optimized while also reducing your carbon footprint.
